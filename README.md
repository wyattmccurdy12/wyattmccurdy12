Hello, my name is Wyatt McCurdy. 

I am a graduate student at the University of Southern Maine, working on real-world applications for machine learning. 

My projects include using remote sensing data to investigate issues in forest management, using sentiment analysis to identify risk factors in internet users, and the use of mobile phone images for insect order classification. 

I have a bachelor's in Environmental Science and a master's in Forestry (focused on mapping and remote sensing). 
I am currently working on a master's in Computer Science, because I believe that fluency in data processing is key to understanding the world and effecting positive change.
